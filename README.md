# Image Viewer Project
# Overview:
This project is an Image Viewer written in Java. 
Using this program, the user can select an image from their desired file and view it, or apply changes such as adjusting brightness, grayscale, or resizing the image on their chosen picture. 
# Program Structure:
Initially, upon running the program, a page titled "Image Viewer" opens, which includes 6 different options: Choose Image, Show Image, Brightness, Gray Scale, Resize, and Exit. 
# Options:
# 1) Choose Image:
By selecting this button, a panel opens where the user chooses their image from a file whose address has been previously provided in the program.(For example, I have uploaded a file named "photos" here that you can use later on and within the program.)
# 2) Show Image:
Clicking this button displays the user's selected image in a new frame.
# 3) Brightness:
Upon choosing this option, we navigate to a new page where the user enters a number between 0 and 1, and ultimately by clicking the Result button, the brightness of the image will be changed
Now, by clicking the Return button, we can return to the initial page of the program.
# 4) Gray Scale:
Clicking this button displays the user's previously chosen image in grayscale in a new frame.
# 5) Resize:
By selecting this button, a panel is shown to the user where they can specify the length and width for their image and by clicking the Show Result button, they can resize the image.
Choosing the back button allows us to return to the initial page of the program.
# 6) Exit:
Selecting this button closes the program entirely.
